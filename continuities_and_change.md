# Continuity in the Nature of War & Change in the Character of Warfare (Notes)

1. War is a contest of Wills
1. Width, Depth, and Context
   * Width: over time
   * Depth: tidy outlines disolve and see war as it is chaotic, profoundly human
   * Context: what we achieve politically in armed conflict, a society's will and how we generate and sustaine the will to confront increasingly determined and brutal adversaries
1. Uncertain: because of its political and human dimentions
1. Determined adverseries adapt constantly and evolve conflicts that you don't understand in the outset
1. Thoucidides: reasons for war
   * Fear
   * Honor
   * Interest
1. Sustainable outcomes
1. Technology is the most transferable element of a differential advantage 

## Political Strategy

Understand what is driving a conflict politically and develop a political strategy as the foundation of all other activities to be able to address those drivers of the conflict

Joint power: combine branches of armed forces

## Transnational Terrorists

1. Pit communities against each other...
1. use a local conflict, local competitions for power, resources and survival...
1. to gain a foothold as a patron and protector...
1. they establish control through control mechanisms (intimidation, coercion, etc)...
1. and then solidify their control over people and territory.

### Requirements

1. build cappabilities
1. be leggitimacy
1. build the will to confront a brutal enemy

## Russia in Ukraine

### What happened

1. wage **limited** war
1. for **limited** objectives
1. portay the international community's reaction as escalatory

### What to do (one way)

1. fort deterrence
1. ratchet the price up of taking action like that at the frontier

(Jacob grigols)(?)

## What the enemy will try to do, to us, in the future

1. evade our cappabilities (countermeasures)
1. disrupt our cappabilities
1. emulate our cappabilities (technology is the most transferable element of a differential advantage)
1. expand into other battlegrounds (cyber, political infiltrarion, etc)

## Uses of Cyberspace

1. defend our own networks and cappabilities
1. understand our enemies and how they opperate (sources of strength and vulnerabilities)
1. conduct offencive opperation to limit the enemy's ability to use it

Cyberspace is analogous to other domains where you want to ensure your own freedom of movement and action in those domains (maritime, air, etc) and to restrict the enemy's movement and action.
