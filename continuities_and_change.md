# Continuity in the Nature of War & Change in the Character of Warfare (Notes)


## Definitions

Requires balance between continuities and change.

### Continuities in the Nature of War

1. War is an *Extension of Politics*
   * we need to get sustainable political outcomes consistent with our interests
   * army must conduct operations in a way that contributes to those sustainable political outcomes
   * deter conflict
   * army provides foundational cappabilities to join forces
   * project *National Power*
1. War has a *Human Dimension*
   * Thucidides identified three reason for people to go to war
      1. fear
      1. honor
      1. interest
   * develop situational understanding
      1. understand why people are fighting
         1. be there
         1. gain that understanding
         1. push that understanding up
      1. integrating intelligence and operations
1. War is *uncertain*
   * because of its political and human dimensions
   * interaction with an enemy or multiple enemies
   * action and counter-actions
   * progress in a war is non-linear
   * ability to continuously learn about their invironments
   * inticipate and see changes in the character of conflict
   * adapt
   * emphasise
      1. **seize** the initiative
      1. **retain** the initiative
      1. **exploit** the initiative
1. War is a *contest of wills*
   * communicate out determination in conflict
   * compel the political outcome
   * at the tactical level
      1. build resilient soldiers
      1. build cohesive teams
      1. build organizations that can operate in complex environments and environments of persistent danger


### Changes in the character of warfare

1. changes in the nature of the threats
1. changes in the type of missions
1. changes in technology
1. history and lessons learned

### Additional analytical concepts

1. Width, Depth, and Context
   * Width: over time
   * Depth: tidy outlines disolve and see war as it is chaotic, profoundly human
   * Context: what we achieve politically in armed conflict, a society's will and how we generate and sustaine the will to confront increasingly determined and brutal adversaries
1. Determined adverseries adapt constantly and evolve conflicts that you don't understand in the outset
1. Sustainable outcomes
1. Technology is the most transferable element of a differential advantage 


## Political Strategy

Understand what is driving a conflict politically and develop a political strategy as the foundation of all other activities to be able to address those drivers of the conflict.

## Transnational Terrorists

1. Pit communities against each other...
1. use a local conflict, local competitions for power, resources and survival...
1. to gain a foothold as a patron and protector...
1. they establish control through control mechanisms (intimidation, coercion, etc)...
1. and then solidify their control over people and territory.

### Requirements

1. build cappabilities
1. leggitimacy
1. build the will to confront a brutal enemy


## Russia in Ukraine

### What happened

1. wage **limited** war
1. for **limited** objectives
1. portay the international community's reaction as escalatory

### What to do (one way)

1. fort deterrence
1. ratchet the price up of taking action like that at the frontier

(Jacob grigols)(?)


## What the enemy will try to do, to us, in the future

1. **evade** our cappabilities (countermeasures)
1. **disrupt** our cappabilities
1. **emulate** our cappabilities (technology is the most transferable element of a differential advantage)
1. **expand** into other battlegrounds (cyber, political infiltrarion, etc)


## Uses of Cyberspace

1. **defend** our own networks and cappabilities
1. **understand** our enemies and how they opperate (sources of strength and vulnerabilities)
1. conduct **offencive** opperation to limit the enemy's ability to use it

Cyberspace is analogous to other domains where you want to ensure your own freedom of movement and action in those domains (maritime, air, etc) and to restrict the enemy's movement and action.


## Future force development emphasis

1. Joint power: combine branches of armed forces
1. Expeditionary maneuvers
1. Leader development
   * how a soldier connects what he is doing to a political outcome
   * can you explain to your soldiers how the risks they're taking and the sucrifices they're making are contributing to an outcome worthy of those risks and sacrifices
1. Clarity in the stratigic thinking and planing


## Role of the Military

1. Best military advice
1. Not cross the line between:
   * advice and
   * advocacy of policy


## Additional attributes to develop for soldiers

Complicated environments where enemies intemingle with civilian population and environments of persistant danger.

We need soldier preparation: 

1. Moral
1. Ethical
1. Psychological

In sort inculcate in our soldiers our values and our warrior ethos.

Lawfare.
