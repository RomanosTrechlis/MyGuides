# Continuity in the Nature of War & Change in the Character of Warfare (Notes)

## Basic

1. War is a contest of Wills
1. Width, Depth, and Context
   * Width: over time
   * Depth: tidy outlines disolve and see war as it is chaotic, profoundly human
   * Context: what we achieve politically in armed conflict, a society's will and how we generate and sustaine the will to confront increasingly determined and brutal adversaries
1. Uncertain: because of its political and human dimentions
1. Determined adverseries adapt constantly and evolve conflicts that you don't understand in the outset
1. Thoucidides: reasons for war
   * Fear
   * Honor
   * Interest
1. Sustainable outcomes
1. Technology is the most transferable element of a differential advantage 

## Political Strategy

Understand what is driving a conflict politically and develop a political strategy as the foundation of all other activities to be able to address those drivers of the conflict

## Transnational Terrorists

1. Pit communities against each other...
1. use a local conflict, local competitions for power, resources and survival...
1. to gain a foothold as a patron and protector...
1. they establish control through control mechanisms (intimidation, coercion, etc)...
1. and then solidify their control over people and territory.

### Requirements

1. build cappabilities
1. leggitimacy
1. build the will to confront a brutal enemy

## Russia in Ukraine

### What happened

1. wage **limited** war
1. for **limited** objectives
1. portay the international community's reaction as escalatory

### What to do (one way)

1. fort deterrence
1. ratchet the price up of taking action like that at the frontier

(Jacob grigols)(?)

## What the enemy will try to do, to us, in the future

1. **evade** our cappabilities (countermeasures)
1. **disrupt** our cappabilities
1. **emulate** our cappabilities (technology is the most transferable element of a differential advantage)
1. **expand** into other battlegrounds (cyber, political infiltrarion, etc)

## Uses of Cyberspace

1. **defend** our own networks and cappabilities
1. **understand** our enemies and how they opperate (sources of strength and vulnerabilities)
1. conduct **offencive** opperation to limit the enemy's ability to use it

Cyberspace is analogous to other domains where you want to ensure your own freedom of movement and action in those domains (maritime, air, etc) and to restrict the enemy's movement and action.

## Future force development emphasis

1. Joint power: combine branches of armed forces
1. Expeditionary maneuvers
1. Leader development
   * how a soldier connects what he is doing to a political outcome
   * can you explain to your soldiers how the risks they're taking and the sucrifices they're making are contributing to an outcome worthy of those risks and sacrifices
1. Clarity in the stratigic thinking and planing

## Role of the Military

1. Best military advice
1. Not cross the line between:
   * advice and
   * advocacy of policy

## Additional attributes to develop for soldiers

Complicated environments where enemies intemingle with civilian population and environments of persistant danger.

We need soldier preparation: 

1. Moral
1. Ethical
1. Psychological

In sort inculcate in our soldiers our values and our warrior ethos.

Lawfare.
