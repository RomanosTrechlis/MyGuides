## Part II Chapter 5
### Of the Division, and Graduation of the Sword

The present Demonstration, teaches the Graduation of Force that must be considered in the Sword. 
And for this it is divided into ten equal parts, that we call **Grades**, starting from the tip, numbered one to the guard numbered ten. 
Be warned that as the Grades are increased so the force is increased.
The reason is clear and natural, because as the body is the scepter of the force, and this (TN: the body) communicates it (TN: the force) to the Sword by means of the arm, it is true that that part, or the grade that is closest to the arm, will have more force, for being closer to the origin, and that everything that is diverted, will lose the strength and value. 
Therefore, the number one is the degree of weakness, because it is the most distant from the body.

Experience shows us the greatness of this principle, and the need for its knowledge and speculation. Because the Dexterous has at his disposal, and will be able to decrease the force to its opponent, and increase it (TN: the force) if he by nature lacks it (ΤΝ: if he lacks force). 
And to be better assured of this proposition, you can consider with the sword equal to length and graduation, that he gets to communicates his will by touching on her (TN: the sword) with number six and number five.
With which comes the Dexterous, being in a grade of weakness, and his opponent in one of force. 
And in this case he must graduate, putting his sword number seven to his opponents number three, thus increasing his force, everything that surpasses in number, which are four Grades, leaving the opponent with as many decreasing (TN: Grades).
And so we have the General Rule, that the greater numbers (TN: Grades) have superiority over the minors; and with this warning one must always try to put the most on the least, and he will get to be superiorly graduated and defended.

With these principles layed down, which comprise the universal all that can be treated in this Science, it seems to me that there is a difficulty, so clearly manifested, that if we fade it, it will be quite possible that some (TN: people) will remain in the consequences that causes.
And it is, that this Science is particularly seeking self-defense and offence of the counter(? opponent ?) (case that contains for the defense), and this is so different from one of the other (? defense/offense ?), to be on the extremes, it seems that with only a few principles one can not understand two things so contrary to one another, that it was sufficient to take advantage of one of the two, defense or offense, and that other precepts were given to the other.
But as the universal includes everything (which shall not call them particular), it is certain that under the same principles there is the convinient opposition by the inequality, and opposition that is experienced among its species, and even in one, lie the graduation or the measurment of time.
But in order to remove any kind of doubt, it is necessary to go on declaring the oppositions and the propositions vanishing with which we may proceed without embarrassment.
