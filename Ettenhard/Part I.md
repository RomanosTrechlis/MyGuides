### Of the Principles of Geometry necessary in Destreza, for the knowledge of the Demonstrations and comprehension of the Terms

The first thing to note on the Geometry is the Point, from which everything depends.
Euclides defines it, saying: the Point is that whose dimention is none. 
However, in order to be clearly explained I say that: the Point is the thinnest mark that can be made by puting the pen on the paper, as it is shown by the letter (A) in the first Demonstration.

Following the Point, the Line, which has nothing but length, which is the same as the width. 
Consider a very subtle line composed of thin points.
There are three kinds of Lines, some are called Straights, some other Curves, and some other Mixed.
The Straight is the brief extension from one point to another.
They are Regular because they are always thrown in one way. (?)
The are anotated in the folowing Demonstration as markes the letter (B).
The Curve is the one that in its journey is crooked, so that it is not equally between two points, shown by the letter (C).
The Mixed is composed by a Straight and a Curve
They are Regular or irregular as well as Curves, in the following Demonstration it is shown with the letter (D).

Angles are formed from the Lines when two come to meet in a Point.
Note that if it is made up of Straights, it is called for this reason Rectilinear.
If it is composed of Curves, Curvilinear. (?)
